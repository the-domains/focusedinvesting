Investing is undoubtedly one of the few ways available to get rich ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6e3f8c50-15b9-4a88-b5bf-931d78f24bfc.jpg)

Investing is undoubtedly one of the few ways available to get rich, or at least richer than before.
In fact, when you consider what has been the most followed way to accumulate wealth over the past decades, we find it is mainly two:
- Start a business that will grow over time
- Own shares in a business that will grow over time
Personally, I am of the opinion that, between the two, the most convenient way (by counting the number of businesses available in the entire stock market in almost the whole world: USA, Canada and Europe) and also the most accessible (everyone can access it, without even having to speak directly to the Board of Directors to obtain the ownership interests, in fact just "publicly traded companies" are considered for this reason). As a result, not only does it allow us to acquire shares in good companies (which would be completely off limits to a small audience), but at the same time to get shares at a great price compared to the real "value" (or "evaluated" value) of the company in question.
I think that investing in the stock market is something special available to more, and instead I see regularly, especially by those who have few assets, despising of the stock market and the associating of Wall Street with increasingly negative terms with the passage of time.

If it is true that fund managers only think of their year-end bonuses and the costs of those who invest in them, and that no one forces us to do this particular job (fortunately, I would say), we then have the ability to make independent decisions and invest in what best suits our needs --- what we consider fair and understandable for our level of expertise.
You should also remember that with knowledge from the Internet, we are able to invest not only in virtually all stock markets around the world, but also in penny stocks. Moreover, we can invest in smaller capitalized companies (microcap companies, further reading: http://investorfieldguide.com/stocks-that-triple-in-one-year/), which in most cases can pose a greater risk / reward balance, and which allow the small investor to access the management of the companies in which it invests (of course this is not even remotely conceivable in large cap companies). More to the point, when investing, by following the basic principles of Value Investing, it is essential to have a long term vision of where we are investing our savings, thereby earning the qualification of "hard work."
